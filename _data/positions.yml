    As a Visual Designer at Rebel & Bird, you will help us create some of the most compelling online experiences in the world.

    Our clients are as varied as can be, including digital core, e-health, insurance, media and retail. As a Visual Designer, you will need to be able to move from one project to the next without missing a beat.

    The ability to contribute ideas and execute the ideas of others quickly and competently is key. We’re looking for multifaceted, collaborative designers to work on everything from full website rebuilds to global marketing. This is an opportunity to define and reinvent the digital space, and a passion for doing just that is critical—we want people who believe in their skills and their perspective and are ready to bring that awesomeness to our projects.

  requirements:
    - "A healthy design background: 2+ years of interactive experience (preferably agency experience), an intimate knowledge of industry tools, and solid understanding of designing intuitive site functionality, interaction, site architecture, user interfaces, and navigation."
    - "A love of the craft and pride in pixel perfection."
    - "The ability to both work autonomously and as part of a team."
    - "Strong conceptual thinking. Designers are expected to not just flawlessly execute teammates’ ideas but also be a part of the initial creative process."
    - "An ability to thrive in an environment with plenty of freedom and lots of responsibility."
